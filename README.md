To generate a text-based adventure game world run generate_world.py with two arguments:
first argument: the name of the file that stores the goal state and action sequences
second argument: a name of the adventure that will be generated (used later to retrieve the game)

e.g. python generate_world.py input.txt adventure

To play the generated text-based adventure game run play.py with the name of the adventure you wish to play

e.g. python play.py adventure

To run the code Python 3 must be installed.
To view the visualisation of the generated map Pygame must also be installed.
See https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for instruction on how to install pygame
