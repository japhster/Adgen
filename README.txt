To generate a text-based adventure game world run generate_world.py with two arguments:
first argument: the name of the file that stores the goal state and action sequences
second argument: the name of the file that the final plan will be written to

e.g. python generate_world.py input.txt output.txt

To run the code Python 3 must be installed.
To view the visualisation of the generated map Pygame must also be installed.
See https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for instruction on how to install pygame
