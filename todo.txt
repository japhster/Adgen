add extra ways of talking to npcs to unlock more information

maybe split the initial state/goal state from the list of actions in the world.txt file
 - actions are not unique to an adventure, so why have multiple copies of the same information?

introduce monsters to fight, weapons, armour, hit points, experience, character saving, etc.
when creating an adventure the user needs to specify:
    - exp received on completion of the adventure
    - monster exp, hit points and damage (could all be ranges or prespecified and user picks from a list)
    - items that can be carried through to different adventures (permanent items (p-items)) vs. items that are specific to that adventure
      (single-use items (su-items)

at the end of an adventure, all items in the player's inventory that are p-items will be saved to the adventure's inventory.
if the adventure is ended before the player reaches the goal, a prompt will ask if the player wishes to save their progress.
 - if so, a game directory labelled as the game's title will be created in the charater's save directory, with a new copy of the
   world.txt found in the game that can be loaded on introduction to the game

introduce a special, unique adventure called "The Marketplace"
 - here the player can sell unwanted p-items to different vendors for a price, and purchase wanted p-items with money they have
   earned
