rewrite algorithm for increase complexity thusly:
 - add room
 - random chance that a key will be placed (.1)
 - generate connections
 - for each door random chance that the door will be locked (.2)
   - random key (that already exists in the world) required to open the door
 - random chance that (if it is not already placed) a torch is placed (.05)
 - random chance that (if a torch exists in the world) the generated room is made dark
